              This is my file content for the Artical-1. An unvisited link is underlined and blue .A visited link is underlined and purple .An active link is underlined and red.In HTML 4.01, the  tag could be either a hyperlink or an anchor. In HTML5, the  tag is always a hyperlink, but if it has no href attribute, it is only a placeholder for a hyperlink.
